# Step-by-Step Guide: Building Your Own Generative AI (RAG) System

## 1. Define Your Use Case
- What questions should your AI answer?
- Who are your users?
- What data do you need (FAQs, manuals, reports, etc.)?

## 2. Collect and Prepare Data
- Gather documents (PDFs, web pages, text files, etc.)
- Clean and preprocess text (remove noise, fix encoding)
- Organize data into a consistent format (markdown, JSON, etc.)

## 3. Build a Knowledge Base
- Split documents into chunks (e.g., paragraphs, sections)
- Store each chunk with metadata (title, source, etc.)
- Save as markdown or JSON for easy processing

## 4. Generate Embeddings & Create a Vector Store
- Choose an embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Convert each chunk to a vector (embedding)
- Store vectors in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)

## 5. Integrate a Language Model (LLM)
- Choose your LLM: OpenAI (cloud), Ollama (local), HuggingFace, etc.
- Set up the LLM to answer questions using retrieved context
- Use frameworks like LangChain for easy integration

## 6. Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
- On each user question:
  1. Embed the question
  2. Retrieve top-k relevant chunks from the vector store
  3. Pass context + question to the LLM for answer generation

## 7. Expose Your System via API or Web Interface
- Use FastAPI or Flask to create a REST API
- Optionally, build a web chat interface (React, Streamlit, etc.)
- Log all interactions for monitoring and improvement

## 8. Add MLOps: Experiment Tracking & Data Versioning
- Use MLflow to track:
  - Latency, token usage, retrieval quality, etc.
  - Model versions and parameters
- Use DVC to version your data and knowledge base

## 9. Test and Evaluate
- Create a set of test questions
- Measure accuracy, latency, and user satisfaction
- Iterate on data, retrieval, and prompt engineering

## 10. Deploy and Monitor
- Deploy API/web app to cloud or on-premises
- Monitor health, usage, and errors
- Regularly update data and retrain embeddings as needed

## Tips for Success

- Start small: prototype with a few documents and questions
- Use open-source models for privacy and cost control
- Log everything: questions, answers, retrievals, errors
- Regularly update your knowledge base and embeddings
- Involve users for feedback and improvement
