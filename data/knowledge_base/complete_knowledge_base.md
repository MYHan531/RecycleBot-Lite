# Key Highlights of the 2023 Waste and Recycling Statistics

Singapore observed decreases in waste generated per capita and per dollar Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Domestic waste [1] per capita decreased by more than 15 per cent, and non-domestic waste [2] per dollar GDP by more than 30 per cent over the past decade. This indicates that households and companies have taken positive steps to reduce and reuse.

Per capita and per GDP waste generated decreased in past decadeThe daily domestic waste generated per capita decreased from 1.08 kg in 2013 to 0.88 kg in 2023.Fig. 1. A chart on the daily domestic waste generated per capita from 2013 to 2023.The daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP decreased from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes in 2023.Fig. 2. A chart on the daily non-domestic waste generated per dollar GDP from 2013 to 2023.Recycling rate declined due to structural factorsThere was a decline in the overall recycling rate over the past decade, especially for paper and cardboard. Paper recycling dropped from over 50 per cent a decade ago to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices.The overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023, largely due to the amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.Fig. 3. A chart on the total waste generated from 2013 to 2023.Fig. 4. A chart on the overall recycling rate from 2013 to 2023.Redoubling efforts to improve recycling and resource recoveryNEA promotes the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) in working towards the goal of a Zero Waste Nation. As part of the Singapore Green Plan and Zero Waste Masterplan, we developed a suite of initiatives to shift attitudes and behaviours to make the 3Rs the norm for citizens and businesses. NEA also continues to study and develop new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes exploring the use of mixed materials from Semakau Landfill, which comprise incineration ashes and other waste materials, as reclamation fill.Household recycling participation has been on an uptrend. According to NEA’s 2023 survey on household recycling [3], 72 per cent of households recycle compared to 64 per cent in 2021. In addition, a higher proportion of survey respondents are aware of common items that can be deposited into the recycling bins and chutes. NEA recognises that individual efforts to conserve our resources are vital, and encourages households to not just recycle more, but also to recycle right.There is a greater urgency for each of us to build a sustainability culture where we reduce, reuse, and recycle. By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable.[1] Domestic waste is waste collected from households and trade premises (e.g., shophouses, educational institutions, petrol stations, hawker centres and places of worship).[2] Non-domestic waste is waste generated at industrial and commercial premises.[3]https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/72-per-cent-of-households-recycle-in-2023ANNEX A2013 to 2023 Overall Waste and Recycling Statistics(with and without Construction and Demolition waste)The overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023 largely due to the amount of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste, which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Excluding C&D waste, the overall recycling rate in 2023 was 45 per cent, which is comparable to 2022’s rate at 46 per cent.C&D waste decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023, compared to 2022, because there were fewer demolition projects. Such waste is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts. Hence, sharp Year-on-Year swings in the amount of such waste would result in huge fluctuations to the non-domestic and overall recycling rates. Excluding such waste, the overall recycling rate declined from 51 per cent to 45 per cent over the last decade.

Waste generated by the non-domestic and domestic sectors were 4.97 million tonnes and 1.89 million tonnes respectively in 2023.The overall recycling rate decreased from 57 per cent in 2022 to 52 per cent in 2023. The domestic recycling rate remained stable at 12 per cent and the non-domestic recycling rate decreased to 67 per cent from 72 per cent in 2022.Waste TypeTotal Generated('000 tonnes)Total Recycled('000 tonnes)Recycling RateTotal Disposed('000 tonnes)Ferrous metal1,2961,28999%7Paper/Cardboard1,25138731%863Construction & Demolition83282899%5Plastics957485%909Food75513218%623Horticultural25621885%38Wood44729967%149Ash & sludge2313214%199Textile/Leather21152%206Used slag17617398%3Non-ferrous metal10610599%1Glass7568%69Scrap tyres272695%1Others (stones, ceramics, etc.)2386N.A.1232Overall6,8593,55352%3,306

Note:Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand tonnes and percentage point. Without Construction & Demolition waste, the overall recycling rate was 45% in 2023.1The recycling rate for the "Others" category is not meaningful as it is an aggregation of miscellaneous waste types that are managed and recycled differently.Metal recovered from incineration bottom ash for recycling is excluded from waste disposed of.Wood and horticultural wastes recycled include 447,000 tonnes sent to facilities (e.g. biomass power plants and Sembcorp Energy from Waste plant) for use as fuel.
